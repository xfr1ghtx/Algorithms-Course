# Tasks for algorithms

## [Beginner](1_Beginner)

#### **_About_**
* Before starting the course, letâ€™s go a little bit over what will be taught, who it is for and what you will need to succeed.
* This course covers all of the fundamental data structures and algorithms required to succeed in technical interviews.
#### **_Who is this course for?_**
* If you are someone who is a beginner, this course is for you.
* If you need a refresher, or are trying to switch careers, this course is also for you.
#### **_Content of the course_**
In technical interviews, you will be expected to code up an efficient algorithm, talk comfortably about the design, analysis and tradeoffs of a specific algorithm. Being able to succinctly perform these tasks in a timely fashion and communicate your ideas in a coherent manner is what can make the difference in thousands of dollars of compensation.
